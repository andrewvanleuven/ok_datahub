Agricultural policy projects focus on state, national, and international policies that impact agricultural and rural economies. Projects cover a wide range of policy issues in areas such as farm commodities, food and nutrition, bio fuels, wind energy, conservation, rural development, water use, energy extraction, climate change, immigration reform, invasive species, and international agricultural development. Recent studies have analyzed commodity programs in the 2008 and 2012 farm bills, returning Conservation Reserve Program land to cropland, economic impact of land use changes associated with switchgrass-based ethanol production, food security among Oklahoma Native American tribes, impact of new FDA recommendations on Oklahoma food manufacturers, land use for food vs. fuel, and the impact of water policies in Oklahoma.
