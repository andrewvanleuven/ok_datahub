Natural resources and environmental economics research includes economic analysis of environmental issues, including non-market valuation, optimal land use, irrigation, animal waste management, least cost location of BMPs to meet watershed TMDLs, and institutional design. Past projects have addressed drought and cold tolerant turfgrass adoption and marketing in the Southeastern US, municipal and recreational water use and valuation, wind energy, land use, species protection, water management and hydraulic fracturing interaction, water management and changes in climate, integrating economics in the comprehensive state water plan, and socio-economic behavior and resilience under drought, and climate variability.
